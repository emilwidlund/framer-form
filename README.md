Framer Form is a <a href="https://framer.com" target="_blank">Framer</a>-module built with the purpose of exposing a simple API for rendering 3D-graphics. Its purpose is to take existing 3D-techniques & libraries and expose them in the Framer Environment. It is built to support common Framer-concepts like Animations, States & Events in mind.

### What can you expect from this module?

As most people probably want to import their own models & 3D-meshes to their Framer Prototype, Framer Form will have solid support for a wide array of different file formats. Import anything from FBX, DAE & OBJ to JSON files, and have their respective materials applied with one simple line of code.

### What does the syntax look like?

Framer Form aims to deliver an easy and familiar syntax for all its components. Framer Form has 2 fundamental components that you will interact with.
